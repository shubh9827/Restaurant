         -------------------these are the notes for javascript---------------------------------
->in strings if we add the numbers  with the strings for ex:- "string"+ 100
output:- string100
or 
'100'+'40'
output:-10040

->now here is a new thing in which we will convert the string into numbers and numbers into strings
for ex:- let numberString='123'
let convertedNumber=Number(numberString);
output:-123
now, from number to String 
ex:- let number=123;
let convertString= number.toString();
output:-'123'
------template literals-----
-> template literals are basically something which is been put inside the ` ` aka astrix and inside this for the variables
we use `${welcome + hello} here we can write or add anything here and also we can do operations as well ${convertedNumber}` here welcome and hello and converteNumbers are string variables.
- this used so as to we don't need to think about the inner quotes and + signs and we can do operations and can write our strings in multiple lines.
-> the grouping operator in javascript which is () what it does is inside this anything is taken as a expression and have highest precedence over other operators.
-> null coleascing operator is used in a way as follows:-
let student={
  
    age:null
};
console.warn(student.name ?? 'unknown');
console.warn(student.age ?? 24);
yahan par null coelescing operator jo he keval undefined aur null values kko hi check karta he otherwise nahi karta he agar apan code me empty string aur age me 0 jo ki boolean value false maani jati he par kaam nahi karega.
basically ye null or undefined values ko check karne kliye hi kaam aati he.
